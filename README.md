# Arduino MPU-9250 - Gyroscope Motion Processing

The MPU-9250 is a 9-axis Motion Tracking device that combines a 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis magnetometer and a Digital Motion Processor. 
With its dedicated I2C sensor bus, the MPU-9250 directly provides complete 9-axis DoF output. In this project, the gyroscope function is explored in controlling pitch by
altering elevator deflection angle.

Procedure for using MPU-9250 - refer "arduino_pitch.cpp" - 3 DoF gyrosocpe:
